        <h3>Short Film as a collective of other short films</h3>
        <p>
            In this project we were given random teams and about an hour to make a 60-120 second short video on any thing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We manganed to make a experiance that innterconnects common elements between all of us even though we are at geograpgically different locations. We also managed to use zoom as the main software for recording the short film. it turned out nice even though we had to work to the last second to make it come toghether. 
        </p>

        <h3> Comic Book </h3>
        <p>
            In this Project we made a comic book that take the user to a cute and wholesome journey.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this story we wanted to show just a nice and heart warming story that is inteeractible. One of the main features of this comic is that is drawn by one of our team members and that it has a very simple visual style with page turning animations

       <h3> Sound Project </h3>
        <p>
            In this project we created a story only told through sound.
        </p>
        <p>
            The story was to tell about the mortality of soilders on the front line during World War 1. The story focused on the short journey of an individual Who is terrifed and uncertain of what is going to happen to him in the fornt line. The story sadly ends witht the soldiers demise. The main thing of this project is the amazing sound design that brings everyting to life. The sound design is mostly original with voice lines and war sounds recorded by the team and integrated into the sound design.

       <h3> Video Project </h3>
        <p>
            In this project we tell a story where its December 2020 and the world is ending. A scientist sends four of his students back in time inorder to stop the approaching doom
        </p>
        <p>
            In this story we show four different stories where each of the students goes to his past self and tries to warn themselves about the terrible things that are approaching the next year. each of the stories has a distinct storyline and ending. The important focus of this project is the editing and special effects work that has been done to really flesh out the story and make it engaging for the audience to watch. The duel website layout and text also add to the story and adds a duality of reading and watching to the story.
